        <h1>The Power of Yarn</h1>
        <h2>It's all about yarn</h2>
          <p>Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, used in sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, ropemaking, and the production of textiles. Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing. Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for needlework. Yarn can be made of a number of natural or synthetic materials, and comes in a variety of colors and thicknesses (referred to as <em>"weights"</em>). Although yarn may be dyed different colours, most yarns are solid coloured with a uniform hue.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The human production of yarn is known to have existed since the Stone Age and earlier prehistory, with ancient fiber materials developing from animal hides, to reeds, to early fabrics. Cotton, wool, and silk were the first materials for yarn, and textile trade contributed immensely to the ancient global economy.</p>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
          <p>Yarn is crafted from a diverse array of materials, encompassing animal fibers, natural plant fibers, and synthetic fibers. Animal fibers are sourced from animals like sheep, alpaca, and cashmere goats. Wool, one of the most widely used animal fibers, offers excellent insulation and elasticity. Alpaca fiber is known for its softness and warmth, while cashmere is prized for its luxurious feel. Natural plant fibers, such as cotton, linen, and bamboo, are obtained from plants. Cotton yarn is lightweight, breathable, and ideal for warm-weather garments. Linen yarn possesses strength and durability, making it suitable for items like towels and tablecloths. Bamboo yarn is eco-friendly, with a silky texture and moisture-wicking properties. Synthetic fibers, including acrylic, nylon, and polyester, are man-made materials. Acrylic yarn is cost-effective, machine-washable, and available in a wide range of vibrant colors. Nylon and polyester yarns offer durability and resistance to stretching, making them suitable for items that require durability, like socks or outdoor gear. The diverse materials used in yarn production cater to different preferences, ensuring that crafters have a wealth of options to choose from for their creative projects. </p>

        <h2>Weight</h2>
          <p>Yarn quantities for handcrafts are usually measured and sold by weight in ounces (oz) or grams (g). Common sizes include 25g, 50g, and 100g skeins. Some companies also primarily measure in ounces with common sizes being three-ounce, four-ounce, six-ounce, and eight-ounce skeins. Textile measurements are taken at a standard temperature and humidity, because fibers can absorb moisture from the air. The actual length of the yarn contained in a ball or skein can vary due to the inherent heaviness of the fibre and the thickness of the strand; for instance, a 50 g skein of lace weight mohair may contain several hundred metres, while a 50 g skein of bulky wool may contain only 60 metres.</p>
