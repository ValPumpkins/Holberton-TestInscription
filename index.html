        <h1>The Power of Knitting</h1>
        <h2>What is Knitting</h2>
          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>Knitting is a method for production of textile fabrics by interlacing yarn loops with loops of the same or other yarns. It is used to create many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine. Knitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round (tubular). There are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.</p>

        <h2>Origins of Knitting</h2>
         <h3>A very old craft</h3>
          <div style="padding-bottom: 56.25%; max-width: 100%; position: relative;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCQK6odf9b0?loop=1" width="800" height="450" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
          <p><a href="https://www.alfusaic.net/blog/antiquity/the-history-of-knitting" target="_blank">The oldest knitted artifacts are socks from Egypt</a>, dating from the 11th century. They are a very fine gauge, done with complex colourwork and some have a short row heel, which necessitates the purl stitch. These complexities suggest that knitting is even older than the archeological record can prove. Earlier pieces having a knitted or crocheted appearance have been shown to be made with other techniques, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A5lebinding" target="_blank">NÃ¥lebinding</a>, a technique of making fabric by creating multiple loops with a single needle and thread, much like sewing. Some artefacts have a structure so similar to knitting, for example, 3rd-5th century CE Romano-Egyptian toe-socks, that it is thought the <em>"Coptic stitch"</em> of nalbinding is the forerunner to knitting. Most histories of knitting place its origin somewhere in the Middle East, and from there it spread to Europe by Mediterranean trade routes and later to the Americas with European colonisation.</p>

       <h2>Knit & Purl</h2>
          <h3>The foundations</h3>
          <p>Knit and purl are the foundational stitches in knitting, forming the building blocks for a wide range of stitch patterns and designs. The knit stitch, often represented by a "V" shape, is created by inserting the needle into the front of the stitch, wrapping the yarn around the needle, and pulling it through. It produces a smooth and flat surface on the right side of the fabric. In contrast, the purl stitch, represented by a horizontal bar, is made by inserting the needle into the stitch from the back, wrapping the yarn around the needle in the opposite direction, and pulling it through. Purl stitches create a bumpy texture on the right side of the fabric. By combining knit and purl stitches in various sequences and patterns, knitters can create an array of beautiful and intricate textures, such as ribbing, cables, and lace. Mastering knit and purl opens up endless possibilities for creativity and allows knitters to bring their unique visions to life in their projects.</p>

        <h2>The fabric of Knitting</h2>
          <h3>How does it look like</h3>
          <p>The knitted fabric is a versatile and unique textile that offers a combination of comfort, stretch, and warmth. Created through the interlocking of yarn loops, it forms a structure that allows for flexibility and breathability. Knitted fabric can be produced in different weights and densities, ranging from fine and lightweight to thick and cozy. The fabric possesses inherent elasticity, making it conform to the body's contours and providing a comfortable fit. It is known for its insulating properties, trapping air within the loops to create a layer of warmth. The texture of knitted fabric can vary greatly depending on the stitch patterns used, allowing for a wide range of designs and aesthetics. Whether it's a soft and cozy sweater, a delicate lace shawl, or a durable pair of socks, the knitted fabric combines functionality with beauty, making it a popular choice for clothing, accessories, and home decor.</p>
