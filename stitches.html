        <h1>The most basic stitches</h1>
        <h2>Garter Stitch</h2>
          <h3>The first you learn</h3>
          <p>Garter stitch is a simple and timeless knitting pattern that produces a textured fabric with horizontal ridges. It is created by knitting every stitch on every row, resulting in a uniform and reversible fabric. Garter stitch is ideal for beginner knitters as it involves only one basic stitch, making it easy to learn and master. The resulting fabric is stretchy and squishy, making it perfect for cozy scarves, blankets, and baby garments. Garter stitch also has the advantage of lying flat and not curling at the edges, eliminating the need for additional edge stitches or finishing techniques. It is a versatile stitch pattern that can be combined with other stitch patterns or used on its own to create a classic, textured look. Whether you're a beginner looking to practice your knitting skills or an experienced knitter seeking simplicity and comfort, garter stitch offers a satisfying and versatile option for a variety of projects.</p>

        <h2>Stockinette</h2>
          <h3>The most common</h3>
          <p>Stockinette stitch is another fundamental knitting pattern that creates a smooth and sleek fabric with "V" shaped stitches on one side and horizontal rows of bumps on the other side. It is achieved by knitting one row and purling the next row, repeating these two rows alternately. Stockinette stitch is widely used in knitting projects due to its simplicity and versatility. The smooth side of the fabric is often used as the right side, showcasing the clean and polished appearance of the stitches. This stitch pattern is ideal for creating garments, such as sweaters, cardigans, and hats, as well as accessories like mittens and socks. The resulting fabric has a good amount of drape and is suitable for both lightweight and more substantial yarns. However, it's worth noting that stockinette stitch has a tendency to curl at the edges, so incorporating a border or using blocking techniques can help mitigate this issue. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced knitter, stockinette stitch provides a classic and versatile option for a wide range of knitting projects.</p>

        <h2>Lace</h2>
          <h3>The desired holes</h3>
          <p>Lace knitting is an intricate and delicate technique that creates openwork patterns and intricate designs within a knitted fabric. It involves strategically placed increases and decreases to form decorative holes and motifs. Lace patterns often feature intricate details like floral motifs, geometric shapes, or intricate lace edgings. The resulting fabric has a light and airy feel, making it perfect for lightweight garments, shawls, and accessories. Lace knitting requires attention to detail and concentration, as it often involves working with multiple yarn overs and decreases within a single row. It provides an opportunity for knitters to showcase their skill and create stunning and intricate pieces. Lace patterns can be worked with fine, delicate yarns like lace weight or with heavier yarns for a bolder effect. The versatility of lace knitting allows for a range of designs, from intricate and traditional to modern and geometric.</p>
